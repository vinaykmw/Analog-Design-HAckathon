# Dynamic flip flop

True single phase D flip flop and C2MOS based flip flop 


## TRUE Single Phase D Flip Flop

Following is circuit schemtic of TSPC DFF on Synopsys tool

Conclusion 
TSPC based DFF is not stable for low level technologies and have leakage probles.



Following is circuit schemtic of C2MOS DFF on Synopsys tool
